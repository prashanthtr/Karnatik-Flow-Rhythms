Are there different kinds of adapting?

when is there a need for a secondary percussionist to adapt

really important:

1) has to stop when the mridangam stops unless mridangam gives a right signal to start playing, has to stop when it detects no input

2) when lead percussionist doubles speed -- secondary adapts with playing at the second tempo

3) many cases, secondary is more of volume changes to same pattern

not so important:

3) when lead plays a variation of the pattern --> the immediate next 8 beats is followed with variation shown by the second --> but 

4) rhythm change in high speed -> adapts accent structure



tangential question:

how to use model to map what the lead player plays to the secondary based on each note that the lead player plays


framework idea:

1) note by note -- which does not happen in concerts
maps each note played by lead to a secondary using an arbitrary mapping with no basis
dynamically finds the distance with each acceptable pattern

2) base pattern and variations --> 
real time recognition of base patterns and having a sense of their variations based on the model distance


Adapting seems to be along 2 dimensions:

loudness change -- keeps the same diction but changes accent structure 
	 -> is that enough for secondary : mostly no -> it is likely to intrude with lead if lead is playing in soft volume
	 -> 



speed change -- changes diction

how does the secondary decide its enough to change only the loudness in some cases and in other cases has to change speed -->
